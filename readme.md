## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I first introduced simple visualizations of the number users according to type and gender, and a distribution of their ages, then for the count of the trips in each day and in each hour. I mostly used bar charts and histograms for these univariate visualizations.

After that, I focused on the findings of the relationship between a categorical and numerical variables which are: users' type and age, and users' gender and age, to find their influence on their trip duration.
